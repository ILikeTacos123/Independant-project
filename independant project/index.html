                    <p class="parahs">
                        The variety of plants and animals that live in a particular region or habitat and their interaction with one another are called biodiversity. It defines the biological richness of an ecosystem. 
                        India has a rich biodiversity, ranging from tropical rainforests to desert type of vegetation and alpine vegetation to mangrove forests.
                        Many varieties of flora and fauna can be found in forests. Rainforests have the highest biodiversity of any ecosystem.
                        An ecosystem includes all the living organisms in a specific area and their interactions with the non-living components of environments.

                    <p class="parahs">
                        Biodiversity is important to most aspects of our lives. We value biodiversity for many reasons, some utilitarian, some intrinsic. 
                        This means we value biodiversity both for what it provides to humans, and for the value it has in its own right. 
                        Utilitarian values include the many basic needs humans obtain from biodiversity such as food, fuel, shelter, and medicine. 
                        Further, ecosystems provide crucial services such as pollination, seed dispersal, climate regulation, water purification, nutrient cycling, and control of agricultural pests. 
                        Biodiversity also holds value for potential benefits not yet recognized, such as new medicines and other possible unknown services.

                    <p class="parahs">
                        Over the last century, humans have come to dominate the planet, causing rapid ecosystem change and massive loss of biodiversity across the planet. 
                        This has led some people to refer to the time we now live in as the “anthropocene.” While the Earth has always experienced changes and extinctions, today they are occurring at an unprecedented rate.
                        The underlying causes of biodiversity loss, such as a growing human population and overconsumption are often complex and stem from many interrelated factors.
                        Major direct threats to biodiversity include habitat loss and fragmentation, unsustainable resource use, invasive species, pollution, and global climate change.

                    <h3 class="headings">1. Deforestation</h3>
                    <p class="parahs">
                        Deforestation is the removal of a forest or cluster of trees from land which is then converted to a non-forest use. 
                        Deforestation can involve conversion of forest land to farms, ranches, or urban use. 
                        The most concentrated deforestation occurs in tropical rainforests, which are particularly important to the world because they provide a habitat for millions of species of organisms, they regulate the world’s climate, they store nearly half of the world’s rainwater and they contain plants that are used in modern medications. 
                        Rain forests also absorb massive amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2).

                    <p class="parahs">
                        Ever more people need ever more things. Humankind’s relentless consumption of resources such as timber, oil and minerals is continuing to destroy natural habitats around the globe. 
                        We are also putting enormous pressure on populations of wild species, both by bushmeat hunting in the developing world and by large-scale industrial fishing in our seas. 
                        Wildlife poaching and trafficking still present a huge threat to many species, including rhinos, tigers and pangolins. 
                        There are various levels of endangerment such as, threatened, endangered, vulnerable, and extinct.

                        Ever more people produce ever more climate emissions. Our planet is on the verge of a climate crisis due to our endless production of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and methane. 
                        We are headed for a 3-4 °C warmer world by the end of the century if nations' current climate ambitions are delivered on. 
                        We are already seeing species decline due to global temperature increase. 
                        Every half a degree of warming has a huge knock-on effect on ecosystems, with mobile species running out of areas to migrate to and temperature-sensitive organisms like corals undergoing massive die-offs. 
                        When keystone species like reef-building corals disappear, the rich and complex ecosystems they support collapse as well.
